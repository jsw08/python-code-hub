# Python-code-hub
## Description
Welcome to my project! I'm trying to solve a problem of having a lot of folders for my small python projects. So now I'm making a launcher for my python code!

## Installation and initialization
To run this code, you will need: [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) (Older versions may work.) <br />
Add all the files you want to run to the ```lib``` folder. <br />
After you have installed the package(s), you can run ```win_run.bat``` or ```unix_run.sh``` depending on your system.
